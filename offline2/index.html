      <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
      <p>Our organization is dedicated to raising awareness and inspiring action around sea turtle safety. Currently, only about 1 in 1,000 sea turtles live to be adults. Most threats to sea turtles are caused by humans, such as oil spills, marine debris entagelement, and development-caused habitat loss. We want to change this, and increase the number of surviving sea turtles. Join us in our journey towards a safer world for our sea turtle friends.</p>

      <p>Our team is comprised of an outstanding group of individuals who are passionate about the environment, as well as all of the creatures living in it. We have rallied together to raise awareness in our community, and inspire others to take action. For instance, we were able to organize over 40 beach clean-ups this past year - and we're just getting started!
