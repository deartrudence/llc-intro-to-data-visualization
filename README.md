## Description

### Why learn about data visualization?
In a world where there is more data than most of us really know what to do with, how do we go about displaying facts in a clear and visually engaging way? D3Js is a JavaScript library that helps bring data to life using HTML, CSS, and SVGs. 

D3JS allows us to take big data and make it beautiful and meaningful through data visualization. It’s also great for beginners, as it has a lot of libraries (like c3js.org) that provide pre-designed charts that can be easily customized. 

What will you learn at this workshop? 

In this workshop, we’ll learn the basics of JavaScript while using the console, including concepts like Arrays and Functions. We’ll explore the anatomy of SVGs (scalable vector graphics) and how they can be leveraged programmatically. Learners will use their knowledge to create data visualizations like scatterplots, and make them interactive, for users to engage with and enjoy. 

Specifically, we will cover the following:

* An overview of JavaScript
* An overview of D3JS, why it's cool, and how you can use it in the workplace
* How to create SVGs with code
* How to grab data from the .csv file and visually display it using geometrical shapes
* How to integrate basic user interaction in order to navigate around your data (and be able to see some cool animations!)
* Coding in RGB colour, and the importance of colour in data visualizations.

This project uses [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to maintain consistent coding style. Make sure your text editor has an editorconfig [plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) installed.

**Atom Users:** The Whitespace plugin (which is installed by default) has `Trim trailing whitespace` option turned on by default. Turn this off in the Whitespace plugin settings, otherwise it overwrites the setting in [.editorconfig](.editorconfig). This is a known [issue](https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-editorconfig/issues/3).  This is only required for editing the slides. Workshop learners are not required to add this plugin.
