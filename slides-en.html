        #Why Data visualization?

        In today’s world so much data is being collected that could prove to be useful.  However, large sets of data can often be overwhelming and hard to share meaningful information and insights. Creating visualizations can help distill that information in a more compelling fashion and helps tell a story with the data.  
        
        Creating interactive visualizations for the web can make it even more compelling and easily shareable

        This library takes care of the calculations such as scaling and arching, as well as DOM manipulation and transitions

        D3.js creates SVGs that when combined with HTML &CSS produce responsive websites for sharing complex information.  D3 also uses data-driven transformations and transitions to showcase changes to the data.

        #What is an SVG?

        Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation.

        It is essentially an image written in code that can also be manipulated by code.

        It scales without any loss of image quality and because it is code it can be created by a program.

        #Example SVG

        Note that the tags are very similar to HTML  ```<svg></svg>```

        An svg’s outside tag will be ```<svg></svg>```  and will contain attributes with data about the version as well as size and position. (x y viewbox).

        Next we have the ```<path>``` tag.  These describe the lines and shapes that are part of the svg.  These contain attributes about styling such as fill and stroke.

        They also contain the actual shape/line in the d attribute.

        The `<g>`tag is used to group paths together and usually doesn’t have it’s own attributes.

        The previous code results in the following image.  It can be displayed in Chrome browser like an HTML file if you want to see what it looks like.

        As the name would imply, it is scalable, which means it will remain the same sharpness no matter how big it gets.  Also, because it’s code, it remains minimal in size (a few kbs - which is ideal for fast web pages)

        HTML + CSS + JAVASCRIPT = BASIC WEB PAGE

        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to define the content.

      <p>I'm just a paragraph.</p>

        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to create the presentation and look of a site.

      <p style=”color: blue;” >I'm a paragraph with style.</p>

        JavaScript is a programming language used to define the behavior and used to add functionality to a website.

      <p onclick=”alert(‘hello world’) ”> I'm a paragraph that can be clicked. Try it!</p>

        Before we get into the nitty-gritty details of these JavaScript principles, let’s take a look at a tool called the console.

        We'll be using this tool in the upcoming exercises to focus on getting used to the programming syntax.

        This way, we can write programs without relying on HTML & CSS and learn some of the fundamental programming concepts first.

        Variables are like containers or a box.
        * used to store values
        * can be used any time, whenever you need them
        * gives a name to a value.

        A variable is a named memory location which contains information, to be used at a later time.

        For example, a variable could be used to store a customer's email address. Then, the variable can be used to send a confirmation email.

      var myVariable = "Hello!";

        The value Hello is given to the name myVariable and is declared using the keyword var. This is assigning a value to the variable.

        Evaluate everything to the right of the equals sign, then assign thise value to the variable on the left of the equals sign.

        Cannot contain spaces:
        * Use camelCase for names with multiple words.
        * Every new word is capitalized
        * The result looks kind of like camelHumps
        Cannot contain reserved symbols:
        * math symbols (+, -, =, etc...)
        * javascript-specific symbols ({, }, :, etc...)
        Cannot begin with:
        * a digit (0 - 9)
        JavaScript is case sensitive
        * so variable names are also case sensitive

        Use a descriptive names: var firstName; ← Clear that first name will go here.

        var x; ← Not clear at all.

      var greetingFull = greeting + " " + greetingTime + "!";
        
        The JavaScript above concatenates the three items together like so:
      
      var greetingFull = greeting + " " + greetingTime + "!";
      //var greetingFull = Good + space + morning + exclamation mark

        #What is a Function?

        A function is a name for a set of commands or instructions.

        When using a function, it executes all the commands contained within, making it easier to make the code repeat repetitive steps.

        Let's look at two functions, alert() and prompt(). These come built into JavaScript

        Note the syntax, the parentheses (), must be included

        Go back to the console and type both functions in, one at a time, and see what happens.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>

        #Functions and Arguments

          We've seen now that alert() and prompt() create a pop-ups in the browser but the pop-ups are blank. 

          An argument can be passed into the functions by adding a value within the parentheses ().

          Try this in the console:
        alert("Hello!");
        prompt("What day is it today?");
          It will look similar to this:

          You can create your own functions that can contain any number of instructions that you need, including other functions.
          Use the function keyword to declare a new function.

      function sayAnything(){
      alert("Hello!");
      prompt("What day is it today?");
      }

        The above example creates a new function called sayAnything but similar to variables, nothing will happen until the function is called.

        Call the function by using it’s name and adding () smooth brackets behind it.
      
      sayAnything()

          Methods are functions that are performed on a specific type object.

      Var myName = “SANDRA”
      myName.toLowerCase()

        That method returns “sandra”

        toLowerCase is a function that is specific to the variable type string.  It wouldn’t make any sense to call it on a number.

          This expression returns the string “sandra”

          myName.charAt(3)returns “D” (b/c we’re still referencing the capitalized variable

          However, we can chain the methods together.  The second method will act on the returned value of the previous method.

          myName.toLowerCase().charAt(3) - now returns “d”

          charAt is acting on “sandra”, which was the return value of toLowerCase()

        #What is an Array?

        An array is a way to group similar data together.

        Arrays can be thought of like lists.

        For example you could turn a grocery list into an array.
    var grocery_list = [🍋,🍐,🍅,🍑,🍊,🍒,🍇]

        If we look at the grocery list from the previous slide:
        var grocery_list = [🍋,🍐,🍅,🍑,🍊,🍒,🍇]

        You can see that we create a variable to store the array, in the same way we create a variable to store a single value.

        The array itself is create with square brackets  [ ] and each data value is separated by commas ,

        What kind of data can be stored in array?

        Every type of data 🎉

        Arrays can store numbers: [45, 345, 789]

        They can store strings: [‘this’, ‘that’, ‘the other’]

        They can even store other arrays - this is known as a Matrix 💻
      
      [
      [4, 5, 6, 6 ,7, 8],
      [5, 8, 6, 9 ,1, 3],

        If we're going to spend our afternoon editing web pages, we should understand a bit of what web pages are built with.

        HTML.

        There are three main languages of the Internet (aside from cats):

        * HTML: this is the raw content of a web page. It's the text, the photos, the links.
        * CSS: this is how everything looks. It's the style, the appearance, the design.
        * JavaScript: this is the personality of the web page, how it behaves, how it responds to user inputs.

        #The basic idea of HTML

        HTML is written in tags.

        Tags usually come in pairs &mdash; an opening tag and a closing tag &mdash; to *wrap* the content.  Note the closing tag has a forward slash (`/`).

        ```
        <tag> opening tag --- closing tag </tag>
        ```

        HTML *tags* describe the content inside of them to the web browser.
        ```
        <h1>This tag describes a heading</h1>
        <p>This tag is for paragraphs.</p>

        #Nested tags

        Tags can be *nested* within other tags like this:

        ```
        <outertag>
          outer content
          <innertag>inner content</innertag>
          outer content
        </outertag>
        ```

        Nested tags create a family tree-like relationship, often referred to as *parent* and *child* nodes.

        The inner tag is the child of the outer tag.

        ```
        <parent>
          <child></child>

        # Attributes in images

        Images, the focus of our work today, have one really really important attribute.

        The `src` attribute is used to identify which image we're loading into the page.

        ```
        <img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="Picture description">
        ```

        In addition to the `src` attribute, the `alt` attribute is also required in order to help describe the image for people using assistive technology, such as a screen reader.

        An ```img``` tag by itself doesn't do much until you tell it what image file to load. Once it knows what image you want to use, though, then it becomes powerful.

        We want to have even more fun with our extension. But that's going to be hard if we have to write every single line of code inside quotation marks like that.

        Try something like this:

        That's right: Instead of writing code awkwardly in that spot buried down deep inside functions, you can just tell it to run everything that is inside a separate file.

        The manifest tells the browser to listen to what script.js tells it to do.

        script.js tells the browser to activate the extension button, but not do anything until the button is pressed. When the button is pressed, run anything that's in main.js.

        Instead of changing the background colour, let's do something a little more dramatic.

        ```javascript
        document.body.style = "transition: 5s; transform: rotate(5deg);";

        A variable is a named memory location which contains information, to be used at a later time.

        # Loops

        Humans are really bad at repetitive tasks. Repetitive tasks are also really boring.

        Computers are good at boring repetitive things! We call them loops.

        Essentially, we can take a whole list of things (like a list of images, for example...) and then run the same bit of code on each item.

        What it means for us right now: We can loop through all of the images on the page and change each of them to be the image we want.

        That loop looks a bit like this:
        ```javascript
        var allImages = document.getElementsByTagName('img');
        console.log(allImages);
        for (var i = 0; i < allImages.length; i++) {
          console.log(allImages[i]);
        }
        ```

        Let's break that down:

        * allImages is a variable that contains a list of all the images on the page.
        * i is a variable that tracks which of the images in the list we're currently working with. It's a number that walks up the list of images with us, starting at 0.
        * So i starts at 0, goes until it's reached the length of all the images, increasing by one every time.
        * At each image, it console.logs that image.

        Stand up - let's do this IRL.

        We need a volunteer to stand at the front. They will be the counter.

        The rest of you will be the elements we're looping over. (Either one at a time, or by each row/table group) <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        Counter: You're keeping track of whose turn it is to dance.

        Everyone: Wait your turn. When the counter points to your group/table, follow the instructions below.

        This is basically the code we're running on ourselves:

        ```javascript
        var participants = allOfYouHereToday;

        for (var i = 0; i < participants.length; i++) {
            participants[i].naeNae;
            participants[i].jazzHands;
            participants[i].vogue;
        }
        ```

        ...aaaand GO! <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        See what happened? The counter allowed the functions to reach everyone in the room, but the functions ran exactly the same commands on every person. We looped over them!

        # Loops!

        In code, loops are difficult to read. There's a lot of punctuation in them and a lot of curly braces and a they're weird looking. No worries.

        Whenever you see:

        ```javascript
        allImages[i]
        ```

        That just means this is one of the images on the page, the image we currently care about, the image that we are about to change, the image our counter has currently selected.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # A couple of small details about loops!

        1. There's a shortcut. If you start typing 'for' in your Atom editor, then hit the "tab" key, it will automatically expand a loop for you. Nifty!

        2. There are cases where you might have more than one loop in your script. In that case, it makes sense to not use the same counter variable for both of them, because they could get confused with each other.

          In our example, we're using `i` as the counter variable name. You can use any variable name you like, but using the same variable for two different purposes is usually a bad idea.

      </script>
    </section>


    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Replacing the images

        Now that we have the `allImages[i]` variable that represents the image we want to change, we can add a line of JavaScript in our loop that looks like this:

        ```javascript
        allImages[i].setAttribute('src', 'http://placekitten.com/200/300');
        ```

        That will take the `src` attribute of the image and replace whatever is currently there with a placekitten link.

        Go ahead. Give it a try. Load up any page and place some kittens (or puppies or bears or Bill Murray).

        ----

        ##Note

        If you're offline, or the internet is slow where you are, this is where you would use the link that references the local image on your personal machine that looks a little something like this:

        ```
        file:///Users/williamwolfewylie/Desktop/clc-intro-to-chrome-extensions/offlineImages/300.jpg
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Different images here and there

        The placeholder image links have a /200/300 in them. Those are the width and height of the image they're going to put in place.

        So instead of using the same 200x300 image for every image on our page, we can use the appropriately sized image each time.

        To do this, we need to detect how big the original image in that spot was.

        ```javascript
        var imageHeight = allImages[i].clientHeight;
        var imageWidth = allImages[i].clientWidth;
        ```
        Those two lines create two new variables, and use the `clientHeight` and `clientWidth` attributes to store how big the original images are.


      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Different images here and there

        Then we can string together those new height and width values into the placeholder image link to tie it all together.

        ```javascript
        allImages[i].setAttribute('src', 'http://placekitten.com/' + imageWidth + '/' + imageHeight);
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Different images here and there

        Altogether now, this is how that loop ought to look (approximately):

        ```javascript
        var allImages = document.getElementsByTagName('img');

        for (var i = 0; i < allImages.length; i++) {
          var imageHeight = allImages[i].clientHeight;
          var imageWidth = allImages[i].clientWidth;
          allImages[i].setAttribute('src', 'http://placekitten.com/' + imageWidth + '/' + imageHeight);
        }
        ```

        ----

        ##Note

        If you're using the offline mode, you can't use the `width` and `height` attributes to figure out the best image for the page. But you can randomize the images you have available to you to make the best of it.

        The first variable, `baseLink`, should be the first part of your own browser's link, not exactly as copied below. All of this goes inside the the for loop.

        ```javascript
        var baseLink = "file:///Users/williamwolfewylie/Desktop/clc-intro-to-chrome-extensions/offlineImages/";
        var imagesToPick = ['100.jpg', '200.jpg', '300.jpg', '400.jpg', '500.jpg'];
        var photoToInsert = imagesToPick[Math.floor(Math.random() * imagesToPick.length)];
        allImages[i].setAttribute('src', baseLink + photoToInsert);
        ```
      </script>

        Applying your transitions to the entire page at once is pretty fun. But it's more fun to control which images get your magic touch.

        Let's make that our next feature.

        #Event listeners

        Events are very common in web development. Events are how a web browser interprets what happens when someone clicks their mouse, or scrolls down the page, or finishes loading a page, or hovers over an image on a page. There are literally hundreds of events firing from your web browser every second.

        Event *listeners* are small pieces of code that pay attention to those events.

        Event listeners can be very powerful.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Event listeners

        Event listeners are generally attached to elements that are already on your page. That way you can say "hey, image, when someone clicks on you, this is how you should behave." In that case, we attach an event listener to that image.

        Luckily for us, our previous work on this extension has already allowed us to gather images. We have a line that reads:

        ```javascript
        var allImages = document.getElementsByTagName('img');
        ```

        Then we have another line inside our loop over images that reads:

        ```javascript
        var thisImageHeight = allImages[i].clientHeight;
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Event listeners

        Remember that ```allImages[i]``` means this particular image in our loop.

        So instead of updating it immediately with our new picture, we can tell it to wait until someone clicks on it.

        ```javascript
        allImages[i].addEventListener('click', function() {
          console.log(this);
        });
        ```

        Let's go over each part:

        - ```allImages[i]``` is the particular image on the page.
        - ```addEventListener``` is telling that image to pay attention to an event
        - ```'click'``` tells it what event to pay attention to. It's going to wait for someone to click on it.
        - ```function() {}``` is what happens when someone does click on it. The code to execute when someone clicks on that image goes in between the curly braces.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Wait - what's THIS

        ```javascript
        console.log(this);
        ```

        That's weird.

        The word ```this``` just refers to the item you just clicked on. What did you just click on? This. I just clicked on this: I'm going to console.log() it.

        It's weird to just have one word "this" but it's actually a very powerful tool in our tool box.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Event listeners

        The code right now should look like this:

        ```javascript
        for (var i = 0; i < allImages.length; i++) {
          allImages[i].addEventListener('click', function() {
            console.log(this);
          })
        }
        ```

        Since we have ```this``` we can also act on it just as we did with our previous exercise.

        ```javascript
        var thisImageHeight = this.clientHeight;
        var thisImageWidth = this.clientWidth;
        var imageLink = "http://placekitten.com/" + thisImageWidth + "/" + thisImageHeight;
        this.setAttribute('src', imageLink);
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Stretch goal the first

        All together now, your click-to-replace-image code will be:

        ```javascript
        for (var i = 0; i < allImages.length; i++) {
          allImages[i].addEventListener('click', function() {
            var thisImageHeight = this.clientHeight;
            var thisImageWidth = this.clientWidth;
            var imageLink = "http://placekitten.com/" + thisImageWidth + "/" + thisImageHeight;
            this.setAttribute('src', imageLink);
          });
        }
        ```

        MAGIC!

        #Return of the stretch

        Now that we know how to act on individual elements on the page, we can have a little bit of fun with ```this``` in other ways, too.

        Like, we can make them disappear.

        Take five minutes and see if you can come up with the two different ways we could remove an element from the page.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Stretch to the solution

        First up, we have to select every text element or image element on the page.

        ```javascript
        var myElementsToDisappear = document.getElementsByTagName('img');
        ```

        Note: You could use ```p``` tags or any other kind of tag in this exercise. The world is your oyster.


      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Stretch to the solution

        Loop through them and add your click event listener to them, same as before.

        ```javascript
        for (var i = 0; i < myElementsToDisappear.length; i++) {
          myElementsToDisappear[i].addEventListener('click', function() {

          });
        }
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Stretch to the solution

        From here there are a couple of different ways you can proceed.

        (One of the fun parts about working in code is there are always many different ways to solve a problem: The correct solution is the one that makes sense to you.)

        You can either hide the element from view, or you can delete it entirely from the page.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Hiding from view

        Hiding something from view is a style question. We're making something invisible. Again, there are two ways to approach this task:

        - Changing its opacity.
        - Changing if it's rendered.

        Option 1:
        ```javascript
        this.setAttribute('style', 'opacity: 0')
        ```

        Option 2:
        ```javascript
        this.setAttribute('style', 'visibility: hidden')
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Removing it entirely

        Removing an element from the page entirely is a permanent move. Hiding it from view? That can be undone. Deleting it? Not so much.

        Removing it from view is also a much simpler proposal:

        ```javascript
        this.remove()
        ```

        Boom. Done. Gone.
