        #Why Data visualization?

        In today’s world so much data is being collected that could prove to be useful.  However, large sets of data can often be overwhelming and hard to share meaningful information and insights. Creating visualizations can help distill that information in a more compelling fashion and helps tell a story with the data.

        Creating interactive visualizations for the web can make it even more compelling and easily shareable

        This library takes care of the calculations such as scaling and arching, as well as DOM manipulation and transitions

        D3.js creates SVGs that when combined with HTML &CSS produce responsive websites for sharing complex information.  D3 also uses data-driven transformations and transitions to showcase changes to the data.

        #What is an SVG?

        Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation.

        It is essentially an image written in code that can also be manipulated by code.

        It scales without any loss of image quality and because it is code it can be created by a program.

        #Example SVG

        Note that the tags are very similar to HTML  ```<svg></svg>```

        An svg’s outside tag will be ```<svg></svg>```  and will contain attributes with data about the version as well as size and position. (x y viewbox).

        Next we have the ```<path>``` tag.  These describe the lines and shapes that are part of the svg.  These contain attributes about styling such as fill and stroke.

        They also contain the actual shape/line in the d attribute.

        The `<g>`tag is used to group paths together and usually doesn’t have it’s own attributes.

        The previous code results in the following image.  It can be displayed in Chrome browser like an HTML file if you want to see what it looks like.

        As the name would imply, it is scalable, which means it will remain the same sharpness no matter how big it gets.  Also, because it’s code, it remains minimal in size (a few kbs - which is ideal for fast web pages)

        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to define the content.

      <p>I'm just a paragraph.</p>

        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to create the presentation and look of a site.

      <p style=”color: blue;” >I'm a paragraph with style.</p>

        JavaScript is a programming language used to define the behavior and used to add functionality to a website.

        Before we get into the nitty-gritty details of these JavaScript principles, let’s take a look at a tool called the console.

        We'll be using this tool in the upcoming exercises to focus on getting used to the programming syntax.

        This way, we can write programs without relying on HTML & CSS and learn some of the fundamental programming concepts first.

        Variables are like containers or a box.
        * used to store values
        * can be used any time, whenever you need them
        * gives a name to a value.

        A variable is a named memory location which contains information, to be used at a later time.

        For example, a variable could be used to store a customer's email address. Then, the variable can be used to send a confirmation email.

      var myVariable = "Hello!";

        The value Hello is given to the name myVariable and is declared using the keyword var. This is assigning a value to the variable.

        Evaluate everything to the right of the equals sign, then assign thise value to the variable on the left of the equals sign.

        Cannot contain spaces:
        * Use camelCase for names with multiple words.
        * Every new word is capitalized
        * The result looks kind of like camelHumps
        Cannot contain reserved symbols:
        * math symbols (+, -, =, etc...)
        * javascript-specific symbols ({, }, :, etc...)
        Cannot begin with:
        * a digit (0 - 9)
        JavaScript is case sensitive
        * so variable names are also case sensitive

        Use a descriptive names: var firstName; ← Clear that first name will go here.

        var x; ← Not clear at all.

      var greeting = "Good";

      var greetingTime = "morning";

      var greetingFull = greeting + " " + greetingTime + "!";

        The JavaScript above concatenates the three items together like so:

      var greetingFull = greeting + " " + greetingTime + "!";
      //var greetingFull = Good + space + morning + exclamation mark
      var greetingFull = Good morning!

      var endingValue = startingValue * multiplier;

        To the right of the ‘=’ startingValue * multiplier; is called an expression.  The variable stores the evaluation of that expression.  In this case 5 * 2 is 10, so the variable endingValue will return a value of 10.

        #What is a Function?

        A function is a name for a set of commands or instructions.

        When using a function, it executes all the commands contained within, making it easier to make the code repeat repetitive steps.

        Let's look at two functions, alert() and prompt(). These come built into JavaScript

        Note the syntax, the parentheses (), must be included

        Go back to the console and type both functions in, one at a time, and see what happens.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>

        #Functions and Arguments

          We've seen now that alert() and prompt() create a pop-ups in the browser but the pop-ups are blank.

          An argument can be passed into the functions by adding a value within the parentheses ().

          Try this in the console:
        alert("Hello!");
        prompt("What day is it today?");
          It will look similar to this:

          You can create your own functions that can contain any number of instructions that you need, including other functions.
          Use the function keyword to declare a new function.

      function sayAnything(){
      alert("Hello!");
      prompt("What day is it today?");
      }

        The above example creates a new function called sayAnything but similar to variables, nothing will happen until the function is called.

        Call the function by using it’s name and adding () smooth brackets behind it.

      sayAnything()

          Methods are functions that are performed on a specific type object.

          For example

      Var myName = “SANDRA”
      myName.toLowerCase()

        That method returns “sandra”

        toLowerCase is a function that is specific to the variable type string.  It wouldn’t make any sense to call it on a number.

          However, we can chain the methods together.  The second method will act on the returned value of the previous method.

          myName.toLowerCase().charAt(3) - now returns “d”

          charAt is acting on “sandra”, which was the return value of toLowerCase()

        #What is an Array?

        An array is a way to group similar data together.

        Arrays can be thought of like lists.

        For example you could turn a grocery list into an array.
    var grocery_list = [🍋,🍐,🍅,🍑,🍊,🍒,🍇]

        #The Anatomy of an Array

        If we look at the grocery list from the previous slide:
        var grocery_list = [🍋,🍐,🍅,🍑,🍊,🍒,🍇]

        You can see that we create a variable to store the array, in the same way we create a variable to store a single value.

        The array itself is create with square brackets  [ ] and each data value is separated by commas ,

        #What kind of data can Arrays Store?

        What kind of data can be stored in array?

        Every type of data 🎉

        Arrays can store numbers: [45, 345, 789]

        They can store strings: [‘this’, ‘that’, ‘the other’]

        They can even store other arrays - this is known as a Matrix 💻

      [
      [4, 5, 6, 6 ,7, 8],
      [5, 8, 6, 9 ,1, 3],
      [1, 9, 3, 4 ,6, 9],
      ]

        Matrixes are how computer stores tabular data - similar to excel.

        * First, select all `circles` inside the svg (currently, there are none... but, just wait!).
        * Next, `data(dataset)` sees there are 12 values in the dataset and passes this values to `enter()` which creates a placeholder for each value, if a circle doesn't exist.
        * Then, `append("circle")` inserts a circle for each placeholder/value.
        * Finally, we define the cx and cy values to plot the circle on the graph.

        **Scales** are functions that map an input range to an output domain.

        We will use a linearScale for our temperature values. For our x-axis, we can use a ordinal scale. `scaleBand` is a type of ordinal scale.

        Much like its scales, D3’s axes are actually functions whose parameters you define.

        There are four different axis function constructors, each one corresponding to a different orientation and placement of labels: d3.axisTop, d3.axisBottom, d3.axisLeft, and d3.axisRight.

        We will use d3.axisBottom for our x-axis and d3.axisLeft for our y-axis. We pass our scales in as an argument to the axis functions.
