      ##Instructor Notes

      ##Ladies Learning Code: Intro to Browser Extensions with JavScript

      <br>
      #Resources

      * Chrome Extensions - Developer page: [https://developer.chrome.com/extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions)

      <br>
      #Schedule

      * <strong>Getting Started (10:00 am - 10:30 am)</strong>: Icebreaker, introducing topic, giving examples.
      * <strong>Intro to Basics of JavaScript (10:30 am - 12:30 pm)</strong>: Adding permissions + researching permissions in other extensions, creating a functioning button (moving over to script file), working extension that changes the background colour, discussion on ethics.
      * <strong>Lunch (12:30 pm - 1:30 pm)</strong>: Lunch should be around 12:30, depending on time that food arrives. The deck is organized so that lunch is around the end of the discussion on ethics (with room for flexibility!).
      * <strong>Intro to Basics of D3 (1:30 pm -2:30 pm)</strong>: HTML review (tags, attributes), how the files work together, adding transitions, exploring other properties that we can change.
      * <strong>Temperature Chart Code Along (2:30 pm - 3:30 pm)</strong>.
      * <strong>Stretch goals! (If you need to fill some time) (30 min- 1 hour).</strong>
      * <strong>Wrap Up (3:30 pm - 4:00 pm)</strong>: Demos ('Show and Tell'), Learning Outcomes, Next Steps.

      #General Notes

      * Important! Please give learners enough time to download learner files from slide 1 - check in with them before continuing from this slide.
      * Show learners how to open files. Go through the steps - e.g. Open Atom > File > add project folder.
      * Show learners how to copy text from slides + paste into atom. Keyboard shortcuts can be new to some learners: Remember to mention them especially since they're invisible to them when you use keyboard shortcuts on the overhead projector.
      * Remind learners to constantly SAVE + REFRESH (and show them how). Make a bunch of changes early to show how saving and refreshing isn't just how to code, it can be fun experimenting. Try an "oops, it broke, undo, save, refresh" to show how save experimenting is.
      * Share shortcuts and tips on navigating between windows. Hot corners, shortcut keys, taskbar hovers. Whatever works.
      * For Demos ("Show and Tell") it might be easier to share projects Gallery Walk-style. Have learners refresh their page and tuck in their chair, then give everyone 5-10 minutes to walk around and test out each other's extensions.

      #Contingency

      There are notes throughout some of the slides that reference what to do if you are offline or the internet is slow where you are. If it's predictable that you will be in a low connectivity environment when delivering this course, it might be worthwhile editing the slides in advance to bring those notes into the primary text spot.

      If using the offline option, learners can apply their extensions to the example websites in offline1 and offline2 folders by right-clicking on the index.html > Open with > Chrome.

      In this case, we will use the images in the imagesOffline folder instead of the online placeholder images.

      ## Note: Common Issue
      When reloading your extension from the Extensions page, if you receive an error message, select "Retry."  If you select "Cancel" the reload icon disappears and you will need to remove then unpack your extension again for the reload icon to reappear.

          <td><strong>Slide 14: HTML vs CSS vs JS</strong>
            House analogy - the html is like the structure/walls/furniture, the css is the design/paint/accessories, and the javascript is the functionality (like the alarm/security system). Also use the body analogy (bones, clothes, personality) if that works better for the crowd.</td>

          <td><strong>Slide 29: Dot Notation</strong>
            SNL skit or MadTV skit that used "aaan theeen" as the punchline. The dots are constantly saying “and then what?”</td>
